## Hello Everyone!
Welcome to my project! This was originally created in 2016 or 2017 when I was a sophomore in high school. Recently, I discovered one of my old flash drives and decided to revisit my early projects.

Looking back at these old projects, I couldn't help but reminisce about the challenges I faced while developing them. It's gratifying to see how far I've come since then and to compare my past work with my current projects. This journey has definitely highlighted my growth as a developer.

Enjoy exploring this piece of my history!
